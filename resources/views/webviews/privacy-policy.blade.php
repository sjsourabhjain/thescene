                <p>We collect certain personal information from Customers when a Customer
                    signs up to our Service that can be used to identify you, such as your
                    name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, and any other
                    information that we deem relevant for the purpose of providing you with our
                    Service or which you provided to use voluntarily. The information we

                <p>As you navigate the Service, we may also collect information through the
                    use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and web
                    beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational
                    Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as
                    browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
                    and the actions you take on the Service (such as the web pages viewed and
                    the links clicked).
                </p>
                <p>Through our import process, we may also collect information provided by
                    Customers, such as the name, company name, address, phone number, email
                    address, revenue, account data, etc of Customer End Users that you choose
                    to share with us. When you provide us with personal information about your
                    Customer End Users, we will only use this information for the specific
                    reason for which it is provided, such as to add new records to your
                    account, or as agreed in the applicable agreement with Customer.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong></p>

                    information, and Internet Service Provider. Without a subpoena, voluntary
                    compliance on the part of your Internet Service Provider, or additional
                    records from a third party, this information alone cannot usually be used

                </p>
                <h4>4. Use of Your Information</h4>
                <p>We may use your information to:</p>
                <p>Enhance or improve User experience, our Site, or our Service.</p>
                <p>Develop and publish broadly applicable experience management insights
                    (such as industry experience management benchmarks, if applicable, provided
                    that only aggregated or de-identified data is used).
                </p>
                <p>Process transactions.</p>
                <p>Send emails about our Site or respond to inquiries.</p>
                <p>Send emails and updates about The Scene, including an email newsletter.</p>
                <p>Perform any other function that we believe in good faith is necessary to

                </p>
                <h4>5. Customer End Users</h4>
                <p>As part of the provision of the Service to Customers, The Scene collects
                    certain information and data about Customer End Users as determined by the
                    applicable Customer (“Customer End User Data”). The Scene does not control
                    or otherwise approve any messages or requests for Customer End User Data
                    made by a Customer to a Customer End User. Customer End Users should be
                    aware that a Customer can request such Customer End User Data from them in
                    order to use the Customer’s products or services and that Customer End User
                    Data may then be included in information given to The Scene or through your
                    use of the Service. Therefore, Customer End Users should review the privacy
                    policy of a Customer’s applicable product or service to assess the security
                    of any information a Customer End User discloses. To the extent that The
                    Scene receives any Customer End User Data, The Scene shall make reasonable
                    efforts, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy, to maintain the
                    confidentiality of such Customer End User Data. The Scene has no direct
                    relationship to the Customer End Users whose Customer End User Data it
                    processes and such Customer End User who seeks access, or who seeks to
                    correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Customer End User Data should direct
                    such a query to the applicable Customer for removal. Once such Customer
                    requests removal of such applicable Customer End User Data, The Scene will
                    respond to such request within one month; provided that (i) such period may
                    be extended by up to two additional months when necessary, taking into
                    account the complexity and number of the requests and (ii) The Scene shall
                    inform you of any such extension within one month of receipt of the
                    request, together with the reasons for the delay.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Customer End User Data</h4>
                <p>The Scene’s Customers may electronically submit Customer End User Data. The
                    Scene will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer
                    End User Data except as provided in The Scene’s applicable agreement with
                    Customer, or as may be required by law. The Scene acknowledges that
                    Customer End Users have the right to access their personal information. If
                    personal information pertaining to a Customer End User has been submitted
                    to us by a Customer and a Customer End User wishes to exercise any rights
                    it may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, Customer End
                    User should inquire with the Customer directly. Because The Scene personnel
                    have limited ability to access data our Customers submit to the Service, if
                    a Customer End User wishes to make a request directly to The Scene, please
                    provide the name of the Customer who submitted your data to the Service. We
                    will refer your request to such Customer and will support them as needed in
                    responding to your request.</p>
                <h4>7. Data Controller and Data Processor; Data Protection Officer</h4>
                <p>We process personal data both as a Processor and as a Controller, each as
                    defined in federal law of the United States of America. The Customer which
                    Customer End Users provided personal data to, with the assistance of the
                    Service, will be the Controller for Customer End User Data. We will be the
                    Processor of Customer End User Data. For Customer personal data, we will be
                    the Controller.
                    <br>
                    The Scene has a Chief Technology Officer (as defined in the Directive and
                    GDPR) who is responsible for matters relating to privacy and data
                    protection. Our Data Protection Officer can be reached as follows:

                <h4>8. Accessing, Editing, and Removing Your Information</h4>
                <p>Customers may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal
                    information they have provided to us by logging into your account on the
                    Site and editing their account. Although most changes may occur
                    immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser’s cache. We
                    take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other
                    devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such. In
                    addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you
                    in our backup and/or database.
                </p>
                <h4>9. Cookies</h4>
                <p>We use cookies to create a session and remember a User as they use our
                    Site, in order to distinguish them from other Users. This provides
                    additional security and convenience beyond simply identifying Users based
                    on their IP address, since more than one User can share the same address.
                    For this reason, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser,
                    and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies
                    and that you consent to our use of cookies in relation to your computer
                    system.
                </p>
                <h4>10. Third Party Websites</h4>
                <p>The Scene may post links to third party websites on its Site. These third
                    party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by The
                    Scene, and you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third
                    party websites.<br>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place,
                    in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third
                    parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to
                    members of the Service or Site. The Scene bears no responsibility for the
                    information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website.
                    Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you
                    visit through third party links.
                </p>
                <h4>11. Third Party Access to Your Information</h4>
                <p>Although you are entering into an Agreement with The Scene to disclose your
                    information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to
                    assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.
                    <br>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may
                    delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your
                    <br>information. For example, our web host stores the information that you
                    provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or
                    assist us in securing our website.<br>
                    It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in
                    the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this
                    Privacy Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every
                    authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant
                    to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the
                    services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or
                    otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or
                    systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these
                    third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for
                    their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly
                    should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
                    <br>
                    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to
                    collect, store, share, and otherwise use your information in conjunction
                    with:
                    <br>Google Analytics
                    <br>TheScene.com
                    <br>MailChimp
                    <br>Google Cloud Services
                    <br>Instagram
                    <br>FaceBook
                    <br>Twitter
                    <br>Tik Tok
                    <br>Music Websites and Forums
                    <br>Stripe
                    </p>
                    <h4>12. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h4>
                    <p>At times it may become necessary or desirable, for legal purposes, to
                        release your information in response to a request from a government agency
                        or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a
                        third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so
                        for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal
                        matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we
                        may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to
                        quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not
                        obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release
                        your information to third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do
                        so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in
                        fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from
                        or relate to the release of your information to a request from law
                        enforcement agencies or private litigants.
                    </p>
                    <h4>13. Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h4>
                    <p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communications
                        with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file
                        complaints concerning unsolicited emails from The Scene since, by providing
                        such information, you agree to receive communications from us or anyone
                        else covered under this Privacy Policy. However, you may unsubscribe from
                        certain communications by notifying The Scene that you no longer wish to
                        receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you
                        from the database.
                    </p>
                    <h4>14. Security Measures</h4>
                    <p>We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Site and Service,
                        including using SSL certificates and vulnerability scanning. However, we
                        make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information.
                        It is in our interest to keep our Site secure, but we recommend that you
                        use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect
                        yourself from security threats.
                    </p>
                    <h4>15. Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
                    <p>The Scene permits residents of the State of California to use its Service.
                        Therefore, it is the intent of The Scene to comply with the California

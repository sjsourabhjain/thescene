                <h1>PLEASE READ THIS MARKETING AFFILIATE PROGRAM AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</h1>
                <!-- Page Description -->
                <p>This is a contract between you (the “Affiliate”) and us (“The Scene”). It
                    describes how we will work together and other aspects of our business
                    relationship. It is a legal document so some of the language is necessarily
                    “legalese” but we have tried to make it as readable as possible.
                </p>
                <p>The Marketing Affiliate Program Agreement applies to your participation in
                    our Marketing Affiliate Program (the “Affiliate Program”). These terms are
                    so important that we cannot have you participate in our Affiliate Program
                    unless you agree to them.
                </p>
                <p>We periodically update these terms. We might also choose to replace these
                    terms in their entirety if, for example, the Affiliate Program changes,
                    ends, or becomes part of an existing program, including our partner
                    programs. If we update or replace the terms we or the Affiliate Tool will
                    let you know via electronic means, which may include an in-app notification
                    or by email. If you don’t agree to the update or replacement, you can
                    choose to terminate as we describe below.

                <h4>Customer Transactions</h4>
                <p>1. Affiliate Program Limits. Each accepted Affiliate Lead will expire
                    according to the information provided in the Affiliate Tool (or if
                    applicable, in the Program Policies) from the date the Affiliate Lead
                    clicked on the Affiliate Link that was made available by you. We will pay
                    you Commission as described in the Affiliate Tool (or if applicable, in the
                    Program Policies) for each new Customer who completes an applicable
                    Customer Transaction after clicking on an Affiliate Lead made available by
                    you, provided that you remain eligible to receive Commission pursuant to
                    the terms of this Agreement. The start of the Customer’s subscription is
                    determined by the date of the first purchase or sign up (as applicable) of
                    the Subscription Service by the Customer and you will receive a Commission
                    payment for that Customer Transaction only, regardless of any additional
                    purchases made by that customer during their Subscription Service. For
                    example, if the initial Customer Transaction is for one user of The Scene
                    Professional, and there is a subsequent purchase by that same customer for
                    an additional user of The Scene Professional for the same subscription,
                    Affiliate will receive Commission for the initial user purchase only. The
                    Affiliate will not be entitled to receive Commission on any additional
                    purchases of The Scene Products by that same Customer.
                </p>
                <p>2. Eligibility. To be eligible for Commission (i) an Affiliate Lead must
                    be accepted and valid in accordance with the ‘Acceptance and Validity’
                    section, (ii) a Customer Transaction must have occurred, (iii) a Customer
                    must remain a customer during the locking period in the Affiliate Tool (or
                    if applicable, in the Program Policies). You are not eligible to receive
                    Commission or any other compensation from us based on transactions for
                    Other Products or if: (i) such compensation is disallowed or limited by
                    federal, state or local law or regulation in the United States or the laws
                    or regulations of your jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable Customer objects
                    to or prohibits such compensation or excludes such compensation from its
                    payments to us or The Scene Affiliates; (iii) the Customer has paid or will
                    pay such commissions, referral fees, or other compensation directly to you,
                    (iv) the Commission payment has been obtained by fraudulent means, misuse
                    of the Affiliate Link, in violation of any Affiliate Program Policies that
                    we make available to you, misuse of the Affiliate Tool or by any other
                    means that we deem to breach the spirit of the Marketing Affiliate Program,
                    or (v) the Customer participates in any of our partner programs, including
                    our Agency Partner Program, Sales Referral Partner Program or Sales
                    Solutions Partner Program and is eligible to receive commission in relation
                    to the Customer Transaction under any of these programs. If at any point
                    you are eligible to receive a revenue share payment or commission under
                    another Program at The Scene, that payment amount will not change based on
                    your participation in the Affiliate Program. For example, you will not be
                    able to receive the Commission set out in this Agreement on any Partner
                    Transaction that was completed whilst participating as a partner in the
                    Solutions Partner Program (as defined in the SolutionsPartner Program
                    Agreement). In competitive situations with other affiliates, we may elect
                    to provide the Commission to the affiliate that we deem to be the most
                    eligible for Commission, at our discretion. We may discontinue Commission
                    payments should any of the eligibility criteria set forth in this
                    subsection fail to be met at any time.
                </p>
                <p>3. Acceptance and Validity. You will only be eligible for a Commission
                    payment for any Customer Transactions that derived from Affiliate Leads
                    generated by the Affiliate Link that we make available to you and are
                    accepted by The Scene. An Affiliate Lead will be considered valid and
                    accepted if, in our reasonable determination: (i) it is a new potential
                    customer of ours, and (ii) is not, at the time of submission or sixty (60)
                    days prior, one of our pre-existing customers, or involved in our active
                    sales process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may choose not to accept
                    an Affiliate Lead in our reasonable discretion. If an Affiliate Lead does
                    not purchase the Subscription Service within the time period described on
                    the Affiliate Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies) of their
                    first click on the Affiliate Link, you will not be eligible for a
                    Commission payment, even if the Affiliate Lead decides to purchase after
                    the time period has expired. An Affiliate Lead is not considered valid if
                    its first click on the Affiliate Link is after this Agreement has expired
                    or terminated. Engagement with Prospects. Once we have received the
                    Affiliate Lead information, we may elect to engage with the prospect
                    directly, regardless of whether or not the Affiliate Lead is valid. If an
                    Affiliate Lead is not valid then we may choose to maintain it in our
                    database and we may choose to engage with such Affiliate Lead. Any
                    engagement between The Scene and an Affiliate Lead will be at The Scene’s
                    discretion.
                </p>
                <p>4. Commission and Payment. In order to receive payment under this
                    Agreement, you must have: (i) agreed to the terms of this Agreement
                    (generally completed through the Affiliate Tool); (ii) completed all steps
                    necessary to create your account in the Affiliate Tool in accordance with
                    our directions, (iii) have a valid and up-to-date payment method in the
                    Affiliate Tool with such account (iv) completed any and all required tax
                    documentation in order for the Affiliate Tool to process any payments that
                    may be owed to you.
                </p>
                <p>5. Requirements for Payment; Forfeiture. Notwithstanding the foregoing
                    or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any of the requirements
                    set forth in section 4(a)(i-iv) remain outstanding for six (6) months
                    immediately following the close of a Customer Transaction, then your right
                    to receive Commission arising from any and all Customer Transactions with
                    the associated Customer will be forever forfeited (each, a “Forfeited
                    Transaction”). We will have no obligation to pay you the Commission
                    associated with a Forfeited Transaction. Once you comply with all of the
                    requirements in section 5(a)(i-iv), then you will be eligible to receive
                    Commission on Customer Transactions, as long as these Customer Transactions
                    do not involve the same Customer associated with a Forfeited Transaction.
                </p>
                <p>6. Commission Payment. We or the Affiliate Tool will determine the
                    currency in which we pay the Commission, as well as the applicable
                    conversion rate. We will not pay more than one Commission payment or other
                    similar referral fee on any given Customer Transaction (unless we choose to
                    in our discretion).Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all taxes and
                    fees (including bank fees) applicable to the Commission. All amounts
                    payable by us to you are subject to offset by us against any amounts owed
                    by you to us. Commission Amounts. We reserve the right to alter or change
                    the Commission amount as per the Affiliate Tool.

                    (“Receiving Party”), (i) whether orally or in writing, that is designated
                    as confidential, and (ii) The Scene customer and prospect information,
                    whether or not otherwise designated as confidential. Confidential

                    confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party
                    using the same degree of care that it uses with its own confidential

                    determine that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that has or may
                    negatively reflect on or affect us, our prospects, or our customers.
                </p>
                <p>5. Effects of Expiration/Termination. Expiration of this Agreement, and
                    termination of this Agreement: (i) without cause by us,(ii) by you with
                    cause, (iii) by you according to the ‘Termination for Agreement Changes’
                    section, shall not affect our obligation to pay you a Commission, so long
                    as the related payment by the Customer Transaction is recognized by us
                    within thirty (30) days after the date of such termination or expiration
                    and provided that in no event shall you be entitled to payment of
                    Commission under this Agreement if you are eligible to receive a revenue
                    share payment under the Solutions Partner Program Agreement. We will not
                    pay you fees on Customer Transactions recognized by us after thirty (30)
                    days after the date of such termination or expiration set out above.
                    Provided however, in the event of termination without cause by you, or for
                    cause by us, our obligation to pay and your right to receive any Commission
                    will terminate upon the date of such termination, regardless of whether you
                    would have otherwise been eligible to receive Commission prior to the date
                    of termination. Except as expressly set forth in this section, you are not
                    eligible to receive a Commission payment after expiration or termination of
                    this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration, you will discontinue all
                    use of and delete the Affiliate Tool that we make available to you for your
                    participation in the Affiliate Program. Upon termination or expiration, an
                    Affiliate Lead is not considered valid, and we may choose to maintain it in
                    our database and engage with such a prospect.
                    Upon termination or expiration, you will immediately discontinue all use
                    of our trademark and references to this Affiliate Program from your
                    website(s) and other collateral. For the avoidance of doubt, termination or
                    expiration of this Agreement shall not cause a Customer’s subscription
                    agreement to be terminated.

				<h1>About The Scene</h1>
				<!-- Page Description -->
				<p class="mb-3">
					If you do what you love, then you never work a day in your life. This amazing and true statement sums up what The Scene is all about! Our community does not mind working hard to promote and support our performing artist, local businesses and philanthropy goals since we don’t feel like it is work at all. Our mission is to sell out every single one of our events no matter the size, location or anything else standing in our way of our shared goals. The Scene is all about having fun also. The saying of “Work Hard, Play Hard” comes to mind but really it should be “Fun Hard, Play Hard” is our opinion because of our process and attitude about our goals.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-3">
					On a much more serious and important note. Our community does work hard to sell out also to make sure we can give as much as we can to charity organizations to do our part in giving back and helping out. All the charity organizations The Scene donates to are highly rated by watch group organizations that rate the charity organizations on several metrics to confirm the quality of the charity organizations. Below is a list of the charity organizations The Scene donates to….
				</p>

				<p class="mb-3">
					Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC®) has a global network of more than 260 Chapters in 62 countries and regions and supports families in accessing medical care for children. RMHC programs provide families with somewhere to stay, in or near leading hospitals and healthcare services, helping to ensure they have access to the medical care their child needs. RMHC is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-3">
					Ronald McDonald House programs, located near top children’s hospitals, allow parents who are far from home to stay close to their hospitalized child and benefit from the comforts of home without incurring hotel and food costs. Ronald McDonald Family Room programs offer a quiet respite for all families right in the hospital. And Ronald McDonald Care Mobile programs bring fundamental medical and dental care to underserved communities. Below is a quote from the organization. “We believe that when families are together, they cope together. We believe that no family should have to deal with their child’s medical crisis.”
				</p>

				<p class="mb-3">
					St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, located in Memphis, Tennessee, was designated as an NCI cancer center in 1977 and named a comprehensive cancer center in 2008. The mission of the St. Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center is to advance cures for pediatric cancer through research and treatment. St. Jude is the only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center dedicated solely to children.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-3">
					The St. Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center brings together physicians and scientists from diverse fields into five multidisciplinary research programs. These programs are designed to drive fundamental scientific discoveries in the biology of pediatric cancer; translate them into treatments and cures for children with brain tumors, solid tumors, and blood cancers; and determine how to help survivors lead longer, healthier lives. Cancer center investigators collaborate extensively across the institution, the United States, and the globe to help children fighting cancer everywhere. Below is a quote from the organization.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-3">
					“Many families come to St. Jude thinking it’s like any other hospital. But because of our supporters, families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food — so they can focus on helping their child live.”

						<!-- Career Description -->
						<p>
						How did we meet again? I am certain that it was not that long ago since our group didn’t get together until recently. Is this your first time visiting The Scene on the web? How did you get here? Did you find The Scene by clicking on one of our e-Links that have been placed on the web by the members of our community in order to support their favorite artist and passion for music? Maybe a friend that is already a member told you that it would be great if you checked us out. Do you want to get involved with ph No matter how you got here, we want to welcome you to our website that serves as the online element of a ticketing platform that is unlike anything else in the Live Music industry.
						</p><br>

						<p>
						Our community really cares about supporting their performing artists which is rare to find when it comes to Live Music industry promotion. Actually caring about others is hard to find in pretty much everything when it comes to the world we live in today. That is what makes this community and the relationships formed in it very special and powerful. If you are or when you become a member of our community then our story together can actually begin. Don’t worry, we are a very inclusive group of passionate music lovers. Also you can participate or not participate in whichever The Scene event promotion activities you want to. Free will and fun are the only pressure you have to worry about.l We do offer a commission of five dollars per ticket sold for any and all of our events for your efforts.
						</p><br>
								
						<p>
						Our story with you will be different and unique just like all our member’s stories. Instead of writing about the past in this section of the website. I think we are all writing a great story together in our shared scene as it unfolds in the present and inspires dreams for our future. The future is much more exciting to dream about. Don’t you agree? I really believe that this is just the beginning of a special story that could be bigger than all of our dreams today combined.

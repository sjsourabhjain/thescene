				<h1>About The Scene</h1>
				<!-- Page Description -->
				<p>If you do what you love, then you never work a day in your life. This
					amazing and true statement sums up what The Scene is all about! Our
					community does not mind working hard to promote and support our performing
					artist since we don’t feel like it is work at all. Our calling and mission
					is to sell out every single one of our events no matter the size, location
					or anything else standing in our way of our shared goal. The Scene is all
					about having fun also. The saying of “Work Hard, Play Hard” comes to mind
					but really it should be “Fun Hard, Play Hard” is our opinion because of our
					process and attitude.

						<h2>This is our story</h2>
						<!-- Career Description -->
						<p>How did we meet again? I am certain that it was not that long ago since
							our group didn’t get together until recently. Is this your first time
							visiting The Scene on the web? How did you get here? Did you find The
							Scene by clicking on one of our many event-links that have been placed on
							the web by the members of our community in order to support their favorite
							artist and passion for music? Maybe a friend that is already a member told
							you that it would be great if you checked us out. No matter how you got
							here, we want to welcome you to our website that serves as the online
							element of a ticketing platform that is unlike anything else in the Live
							Music industry.</p><br>
							<p>Our community really cares about supporting their performing artists which
								is rare to find when it comes to Live Music industry promotion. Actually
								caring about others is hard to find in pretty much everything when it comes
								to the world we live in today. That is what makes this community and the
								relationships formed in it very special and powerful. If you are or when
								you become a member of our community then our story together can actually
								begin. Don’t worry, we are a very inclusive group of passionate music
								lovers. Also you can participate or not participate in whichever The Scene
								event promotion activities you want to. Free will and fun are the only
								pressure you have to worry about.l We do offer a commission of five
								dollars per ticket sold for any and all of our events for your efforts.</p><br>
								<p>Our story with you will be different and unique just like all our member’s
									stories. Instead of writing about the past, we are all writing a great
									story together in our shared scene as it unfolds in the present and
									inspires dreams for our future. The future is much more exciting to dream
									about. Don’t you agree? I really believe that this is just the beginning
									of a special story that could be bigger than all of our dreams today
									combined.</p>

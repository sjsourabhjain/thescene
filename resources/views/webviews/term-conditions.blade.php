                        with any Venue terms, conditions and regulations, copies of which are

                    </li>
                    <li>All Tickets are sold subject to the Conditions. Please read the
                        Conditions carefully before purchase and raise any queries with The Scene
                        before purchase. Your purchase of a Ticket constitutes your acceptance of
                        the Conditions.</li>
                    <li>It is your responsibility to check Your Tickets as, if you have made a
                        mistake, it cannot always be rectified after purchase. Please check your
                        Tickets on receipt carefully and contact The Scene immediately if there is
                        a mistake.</li>
                    <li>It is your responsibility to check Your Tickets as, if you have made a
                        mistake, it cannot always be rectified after purchase. Please check your
                        Tickets on receipt carefully and contact The Scene immediately if there is
                        a mistake.</li>
                    <li>If You have any special access requirements or concerns about any
                        special effects (for example lighting, sound, audiovisual or pyrotechnic
                        effects) which may be featured at the Event, please discuss any such issues
                        before purchasing the Tickets with The Scene by emailing
                        *****@****.***. The Scene and the Venue will use reasonable efforts
                        to assist with any such special access requirements or concerns.
                    </li>

                    <li>You must produce a valid Ticket to gain access to an Event and You must
                        keep possession of such Ticket at all times during the Event. Your Ticket
                        may be invalidated if any part of it is removed, altered or deleted. The
                        Scene will not be responsible for any Ticket that is lost . In some cases,
                        if you have purchased a standing ticket(s) or exclusive enclosure/area
                        ticket(s), a wrist band(s) will be sent to You with your ticket(s). You
                        must bring your wristband(s) with you along with your ticket(s) and wear
                        them at all times in order to gain access to these areas. Lost or forgotten
                        wristbands will not be re issued.</li>
                    <li>Duplicate tickets will be issued at The Scene discretion in
                        collaboration with the Venue. If The Scene issues a duplicate Ticket, it
                        may charge a reasonable administration fee.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our recommendation is that concerts at the Venue are not suitable for
                        children under 16. Whilst we recommend that these events are not suitable
                        for children under 16, if you do wish to bring them as part of your party,
                        at your discretion, they can attend as long as they possess a valid ticket
                        to gain entry and there is a responsible adult of 18 and above to every two
                        children under 16. We take every precaution to try and ensure everyone has
                        a safe and enjoyable time at all of our events. If you do decide to bring a
                        child under 16, we would suggest against taking them into the most densely
                        crowded areas, which includes the large area in front of the stage. It is
                        your responsibility to check the suitability of an event for any children
                        in your party regardless of official age restrictions, this includes
                        considering the type of audience the event is likely to attract and whether
                        such an audience is a suitable environment for children in your party.
                        Refunds will not be issued if any aspect of an event, including the
                        behavior of other audience members, causes offense to you or any children
                        on whose behalf you have purchased tickets. We do not recommend subjecting
                        babies and young children to loud music. Children are recommended to wear
                        hearing protection if you decide to bring them. A concert environment is
                        not suitable for very young children.
                    </li>
                    <li>For seated Events, You only have the right to a seat at the Event of a
                        value corresponding to that stated on the Ticket, and The Scene acting
                        reasonably, reserves the right to provide alternative seats at the Event to
                        those specified on the Ticket. Where only seats of a lesser value are
                        available, You will be offered the choice of accepting either (a) the
                        lesser value seats available, or (b) a refund of the face value of Your
                        Ticket.</li>
                    <li>Tickets are sold subject to The Scene’s right to alter the advertised
                        Event as may reasonably be necessary. The Scene’s and the Venue total
                        liability in relation to a canceled Event is set out below in Conditions 14
                        and 16
                    </li>
                    <li>Tickets can be exchanged at www.thescene.com at no cost but not refunded
                        if the performance is canceled, rescheduled or where there is a material
                        change to the programme of the event. A ‘material’ change is a change
                        which, in The Scene’s reasonable opinion, makes the Event materially
                        different to the Event that purchasers of the Ticket, taken generally,
                        could reasonably expect. Please note that the following are not deemed to
                        be a ‘material’ change: adverse weather conditions; changes of any
                        supporting act; changes to key performing individual members of a band;
                        curtailment of the event where the majority of an event is performed in
                        full; and delays to the starting of the performance of an event.</li>
                    <li>It is Your responsibility to ascertain whether an Event has been
                        canceled or re- scheduled and the date and time of any rescheduled Event.
                        Where an Event is canceled or rescheduled, The Scene and the Venue will use
                        their reasonable endeavors to notify You using the details You provided at
                        the time of ordering. The Scene and the Venue do not and cannot guarantee
                        that You will be informed of such cancellation before the date of the
                        Event. It is also Your responsibility to inform The Scene of any change to
                        the contact address, telephone number or email address You provided at the
                        time of purchase of tickets for the Event.
                    </li>
                    <li>Where an Event is canceled, rescheduled and you cannot or do not wish to
                        attend the rescheduled event or where there is a material change to the
                        programme of the Event, You will be entitled to sell or exchange your
                        ticket(s) in accordance with Condition 14 and Our Covid-19 Supplementary
                        Terms. Liability for the cancellation or rescheduling of the Event, or for
                        material changes to the Event, will be limited as set forth in Condition 14
                        of this document.
                    </li>
                    <li>“Force Majeure” means any cause beyond The Scene’s or the Venues’
                        control including, without limitation, act of God, war, insurrection, riot,
                        civil disturbances, acts of terrorism, fire, explosion, flood, epidemic
                        and/or pandemic, national mourning, theft of essential equipment, malicious
                        damage, strike, lock out, weather, third party injunction, national defence
                        requirements, acts or regulations of national or local governments. Subject
                        to the provisions of Condition 12, The Scene nor the Venue will not be
                        liable to You for failure to perform any obligation under the Conditions to
                        the extent that the failure is caused by Force Majeure.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is no refund ever for ticket(s) purchased. Personal arrangements
                        including travel, subsistence, hospitality or accommodation relating to the
                        Event which have been arranged by You are at Your own risk. The Scene nor
                        the Venue shall not be liable for any loss of enjoyment or wasted
                        expenditure in addition to refunding the face value of the Ticket.
                    </li>
                    <li>You do have the right to sell or transfer your ticket(s) for no fee by
                        using the ticket exchange function on the website, please contact The Scene
                        at *****@****.*** within 3 months of the original proposed date of
                        the Event for a canceled or rescheduled Event, or as soon as possible for
                        the Event which has been materially changed. The Scene reserves the right
                        to alter the price of any Ticket at its sole discretion. If You have
                        already purchased a Ticket to an Event and a cheaper ticket becomes
                        available, The Scene will be under no obligation to refund any portion of
                        the Ticket purchased at the initial price.
                    </li>
                    <li>Neither The Scene nor the Venue will not be liable for any loss, injury
                        or damage to any person (including Yourself) or property however caused:
                        (a) in any circumstances where there is no breach of a legal duty of care
                        owed by The Scene or the Venue, (b) in circumstances where such loss or
                        damage is not a reasonably foreseeable result of any such breach (save for
                        death or personal injury as a result of a breach of a legal duty of care
                        owed by The Scene or the Venue); or (c) to the extent that any loss or
                        damage results from breach by You of any of the Conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Nothing in these Conditions seeks to exclude or limit any liability of
                        The Scene or the Venue for death or personal injury caused by its
                        negligence, fraud or any other type of liability which cannot by law be
                        excluded or limited.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Scene and the Venue will not accept any ticket purchased from an
                        unofficial secondary ticketing website. It is Your sole responsibility to
                        ensure that the Ticket You have purchased is from an official ticket seller
                        of The Scene as identified in Condition 48.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may not re-sell or transfer a Ticket if prohibited by law. In
                        addition, re-sales or transfers of Tickets may be prohibited for the Event,
                        pursuant to the specific terms and conditions of the Event (for example,
                        but not limited to (a) charity Events, (b) Events where age restrictions
                        apply because of the content of the Event or licensing requirements, or (c)
                        balloted Events). Where a Ticket is offered for resale in accordance with
                        the Conditions, You must provide the buyer with full details of the Ticket.
                        Full details include (if printed on the Ticket) the relevant block or tier,
                        and row and seat number. The buyer of a Ticket must be made aware of the
                        Conditions and any other terms and conditions that are specific to the
                        Event. You should check whether any special terms or conditions apply
                        before offering a Ticket for re-sale. Free tickets are often provided for
                        specific reasons limiting their transferability.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may not combine a ticket with any hospitality, travel or
                        accommodation service and/or any other merchandise, product or service to
                        create a ticket package (“Ticket Package”) and sell or otherwise transfer
                        (or facilitate the sale or transfer of) such Ticket Package for profit or
                        commercial gain, offer such Ticket Package as an incentive or prize in a
                        promotion or competition, or otherwise dispose of such Ticket Package in
                        the course of a business.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tickets are personal revocable licenses and shall at all times remain
                        the property of The Scene. Any Ticket obtained in breach of the Conditions
                        will be void. Any person seeking to use a void Ticket may be refused entry
                        to, or ejected from, the Venue without refund, and may be subject to legal
                        action. Void Tickets are non- refundable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number per customer. The Scene
                        will notify You of any such restriction at the time of purchase. The Scene
                        reserves the right, without prior notice, to cancel Tickets purchased in
                        excess of this number, unless the purchase of an excess was due to The
                        Scene’s or the Venue’s error.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Scene and the Venue reserves the right to refuse You entry to
                        and/or eject You from the Event and/or Venue (and may take appropriate
                        action to enforce this right) in reasonable circumstances including without
                        limitation (a) for health and safety or licensing reasons, (b) if You
                        behave in a manner which has or is likely to affect the enjoyment of other
                        persons at the Event, (c) if You use or display threatening, abusive or
                        insulting words or mannerisms or behave in a manner which may provoke a
                        breach of the peace, (d) if, in The Scene ’s or the Venue’s reasonable
                        opinion, You appear to be acting under the influence of alcohol or drugs,
                        (d) if You fail, when required, to produce proof of identity or age, (e) if
                        You refuse to comply with The Scene’s or the Venue’s security searches, (f)
                        if You breach these Terms, or (g) if Your Ticket is void. No refunds will
                        be given to You if You are refused entry or ejected due to Your own
                        behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Scene or the Venue reserves the right to conduct security searches
                        and confiscate any item which in the opinion of The Scene or the Venue may
                        cause danger or disruption to other persons at the Event or is one of the
                        items not permitted in the Venue as listed in the Conditions (including
                        those items listed in these Conditions).
                    </li>
